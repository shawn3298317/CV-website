		"intro": [
			"Image captioning, despite the substantial progress in recent years due to deep learning algorithms, are still far from being perfect. Caption sentences produced by methods like MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation), are often overly rigid and lack in variability due to its constrained optimization function. This principle encourages high resemblance to the ground-truth captions, while suppressing other semantically equivalant descriptions.",
			"Some research proposed adversarial learning methods (e.g. conditional-GAN) to generate greater variety of image captions. However, problem of these sort of methods lies in that they achieve better variability at the cost of sacrificing conventional evaluation metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE.",

			"This project is one of my side projects, it was done during time in Sinovation Venture. And in this project, I tried to explore an alternative approach to guarantee conventional evaluation metrics and caption diversity at the same time. Specifically, I propose a new framework based on Bicycle Generative Adversarial Networks (BicycleGAN) and Contrastive Learning, which jointly learns a generator to produce captions conditioned on images, an discriminator to asses how well a caption fits the visual content, and an encoder to ensure the stability of diversified caption generator. Meanwhile, constrative loss keeps the generator learn better than a reference caption model. It is noteworthy that training a sequence generator is nontrivial. I overcame the difficulty by Policy Gradient, and further solved GAN's vanishing gradient problem via RankGAN, a strategy that stabilize discriminator's expected value. Proposed method was tested on Flickr30k dataset, with 0.059(26%) improvement on BLEU-3 and similar caption diversity comparing to C-GAN baseline."

During the time in Sinovation Venture, we noticed that the change of term meanings and some new domain specific terms often come from some social platforms like Weibo and Twitter. (i.e. Chances are a new word in **Urban Dictionary** dates back to a couple of tweets from some aonymous users.) ",
